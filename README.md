### Hi, I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer who kicked off my journey back in 2019 when I made my first React and Firebase web app with my friends, called "Pogqueue." Since then, I've been hooked on web development. During my internship, I worked on making mobile and web apps that are still used today. When I landed my first full-time job in 2022, I really liked using TypeScript for its clear type system, but I wasn't so keen on the front-end and JavaScript ecosystem. Currently, I'm on the lookout for a role in backend web development, preferebly one where I can work with Go. I'd especially love to join a startup with a small team where I can make a real difference. If you're hiring, let's chat!
