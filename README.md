### Hi, I'm Daniel 👋

I'm a web developer who kicked off my journey back in 2020 when I made a React/Firebase web app with my friends, called [Pogqueue](https://github.com/danielzairin/virtual-queue). Since then, I've been hooked on web development. When I landed my first full-time job in 2022, I really liked using TypeScript for its type system, but I wasn't so keen on the front-end and JavaScript ecosystem. Currently, I'm on the lookout for a role in backend web development, preferebly one where I can work with Go. I'd especially love to join a startup with a small team where I can make a real difference. If you're hiring, let's chat!
