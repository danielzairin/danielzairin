### Hi, I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer who kicked off my journey back in 2020 when I made a React/Firebase web app with my friends, called [Pogqueue](https://github.com/danielzairin/virtual-queue). Since then, I've been hooked on web development. When I landed my first full-time job in 2022, I really liked using TypeScript for its type system, but I wasn't so keen on the front-end and JavaScript ecosystem. Currently, I'm sharpening my backend skills with Go!
